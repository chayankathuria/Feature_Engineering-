## Binarization

Binarization is nothing but converting numerical data into binary values of 0s and 1s based on
a threshold value. If the value is more than the threshold, it is assigned 1, else 0.

This can be done by simply putting a condition on the column and assigining 1 to values more than a threshold.
Binarizer in the preprocessing module does this task by using the threshold parameter
